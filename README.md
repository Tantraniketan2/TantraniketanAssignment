# TantraniketanAssignment on GitHub
We started by creating our account on GitHub.

There were 3 areas of discussion: Working Directory(where untracked files are present), Staging area(where tracked files are present), Git Repository(where committed files are present).

'git init' command is used to initialize the git.

'git status' command is used to show if commits are done yet or not.

'git add _test-name_' command is used to add our file.

'git commit -m "_anystring_"' is used to commit the file.

'git config --global user.name "_username_"' and 'git config --global user.email "_usermail_"' are used when we get an error of tell me who you are.

'git remote add origin _link_' command was used.

'git branch' is used when we want to know the current branch.

'git branch -M "_anystring_"' command to create a new branch.

**#to add a new file**

'git add _newfile.html_'

'git commit -m "_anystring_"'

'git push origin _branchname_'

**#to download repo or files**

//copy link and open terminal/cmd

'git clone _link_'

'cd _name_' #to change directory

'git switch _new-branch_' to switch the branch

'git log' command is to see the commit changes(history of commits)

'git checkout -b _branch-name_' (difference between checkout and switch is that checkout will create a new branch if not present where switch won't and thus switch is more prefered over checkout.

**#to push commits**

'git fetch _code link_'
